# FishMarketWebApp-FTNInformatika-FinalProject
 This repository hosts my final project for the FTNInformatika .NET Web Development course, focused on building a comprehensive ASP.NET Core Web API application for managing fish markets ('Ribarnice') and their fish stocks ('Ribe'). The project demonstrates proficiency in RESTful API development, Entity Framework Core for data handling, and integration of modern web technologies like Bootstrap and Fetch API. The application includes features such as CRUD operations for fish and markets, advanced search functionalities, and a responsive user interface, showcasing my skills in full-stack web development.
